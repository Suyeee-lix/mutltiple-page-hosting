        All about coffee â˜•
    </h1>
    <p>
        As it's thought that coffee originated in Ethiopia, it's also believed it made its way north, across the red sea
        into
        Yemen in the 15th Century. It then started to be grown here in the Yemeni district of Arabia, and by the 16th
        century it
        was known in Persia, Egypt, Syria, and Turkey.
